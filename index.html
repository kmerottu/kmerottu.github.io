	<H2> Leadership Studies with a second Major of Computing 			     applications
	</H2>
					
	<p> 
		My Goal for this course is to strengthen my understanding of 			computing applications. I am already a pretty tech savvy			person but I have never really understand how to code. So			this gives me an opportunity to better understand the 				process.
	</p>

	<p>	

		I have a major in leadership studies so I would like to be 			able to combine knowledge about computing applications with 			what I already know about leadership principles.	Computing applications in the workplace is a important part of being a leader, i look forward to learning more about computing applications.		</p>
